## 🔍 Project Descriptions

### 📌 Car Price Prediction
Predicts car prices using features like year, km driven, fuel type, etc. Utilizes regression models and feature engineering.

### 📌 Email Spam Detector
Classifies emails as "spam" or "ham" using NLP techniques and vectorization, then applies a Naive Bayes classifier.

### 📌 Iris Flower Classification
A classic ML classification task using the Iris dataset to predict species based on petal/sepal dimensions.
